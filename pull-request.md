# Suggestions to Improve the Service (All Controllers)

- **Standardize API Response Structure**  
  Adopt a uniform response format across all controllers (`{ data: ..., error: ... }`). This improves client-side parsing and simplifies debugging.

- **Add Context Timeouts and Cancellations**  
  API handlers currently do not enforce timeouts. Implement context timeouts (e.g., `context.WithTimeout`) to avoid request leaks on long-running operations.

- **Extract Logging & Response Helpers**  
  Common tasks like extracting the logger or responding with errors could be abstracted into helper functions/middleware to reduce duplication.

- **Define Input Validation Tags in Models or Payloads**  
  Define validation constraints using Go struct tags and use a validation library (e.g., `go-playground/validator`) for automatic enforcement and clearer error messages.

- **Add Unit Tests for Coordinators**  
  The coordinator logic (especially `MarkDeleted`) contains multiple database operations and would benefit from dedicated unit tests with mock DBs.

- **Return Values for Controllers** 
  Consider returning count of messages deleted or confirming affected IDs in the future. Currently returns only status, which may not help clients validate.

# Pull Request Comments

`controllers/messages.go:L20`
> Added constants utility to make message cleaner and reduce repetitive error messages.

`controllers/messages.go:L35`
> Added `getLogger(ctx)` utility to make logger extraction cleaner and reduce repetitive `ok` checks.

`controllers/messages.go:L70-L78`
> Changed raw error messages in client-facing responses to user-friendly strings. Internal error context is preserved via structured logging.

`coordinators/messages.go:L69`
> Wrapped error with `Wrapf` for better traceability and context in logs.

`models/messages.go:L9-L14`
> Replaced db:"..." tags with gorm:"column:..." to align with GORM conventions.
